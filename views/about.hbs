        <h2>About this newsletter</h2>
        <div class="blurb">
          <p>I started this newsletter after realizing how hard it is for most people to keep up with the fast-paced tech world.</p>
          <p>Every week there are hundreds of stories across a variety of news sites and it's impossible to keep up. It can be truly overwhelming and tiring for many.</p>
          <p>Over the years I've learnt which news sources are the best and spend most of my spare time consuming the news, but I wanted to give back. I wanted to help wade through the huge amount of news churned out daily and find the stuff that matters.</p>
          <p>Charged is the result of that. Yes, it's a email newsletter, but it's not like  those spam emails you're used to getting. I hate my time being wasted just as much as you do.</p>
          <p>I spend a significant amount of time wading through the news and finding you the best reads so you don't have to go looking. I spend time curating this content so your time isn't wasted and you get a digest of the best news/blogs/startups of the week with a little opinion/commentary thrown in.</p>
          <p>I hope you'll join this ride with me - Charged gathers best news, blogs and startups every week and delivers them directly to your inbox for weekend reading. No clickbait, just great stories.</p>
          <p>Old editions of Charged are available <a href="http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=7ba9643cb80dac69c6818848c&id=00010c34a8">here if you want to see what you're signing up for first</a>.</p>
